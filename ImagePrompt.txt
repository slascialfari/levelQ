Create a 2D side-view background for a horizontal video game level.

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY):
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (1280×720).
- Camera: fixed side view, orthographic (NO perspective, NO depth vanishing points).
- Composition:
  - Bottom area is the ground/floor.
  - The walkable ground line must visually align at approximately Y = 560 pixels from the top.
  - The ground should have thickness (stones, curb, pavement, soil, etc.) extending both slightly above and below that line.
- Do NOT include any characters, people, animals, or creatures.
- Do NOT include portals, doors, gates, or obvious exits.
- Background only, no foreground UI elements.
- Clean edges, no motion blur.

STYLE & RENDERING:
Van Gogh painting style 

SETTING: grass/hey/flower field

MOOD:
- Atmosphere: melancholic, lonely 

ADDITIONAL RULES:
- Keep the scene readable and not visually noisy.
- The ground must clearly read as a surface the character can walk on.
- The upper area should contain environmental details (buildings, clouds, structures, sky) but remain secondary to the floor alignment.
